# Url Shortening Service

This is a project done as a code test for FarmDrop. The test was to shorten a url string like bitly.com, returning a randomly generated string. Then when the string is queried, the client is redirected to the original url.

This is a Ruby on Rails project. To set it up:

```sh
  $ bundle
  $ rails s
```

The project should work from there.

If you want to access the console, `$ rails c`

If you want to run the tests, `rspec`
